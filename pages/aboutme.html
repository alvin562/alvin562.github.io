            <p class="about-description">Hello!  My name is Alvin and this is my personal website!  I am a recent graduate from the University of California, Irvine.  I love working on difficult coding problems and developing software.  My core technical skills include Python, C++, and Java.  Now that I'm done with school, I plan on using my degree to pursue my dream of becoming a software engineer.  In my free time, when I'm not coding on my computer, you can find me hanging out with friends, playing basketball, or just going out to eat.  If you would like to know more about me just shoot me an email and I would love to hear from you!</p>
