Hello!  My name is Alvin and this is my personal website!  A little bit about myself, I am a recent graduate from the University of California, Irvine.  As a computer science major, I love working on diffcult coding problems and developing software.  My core technical skills include Python, C++, and Java.  Now that I'm done with school, I plan on using my degree to pursue my dream of becoming a software engineer.  In my free time, when I'm not on my computer coding, you can find me hanging out with friends, playing basketball, or just going out for a run.  If you would like to know more about me just shoot me an email and I would love to hear from you!
